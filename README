The Agile bit: 

"As a systems administrator I wish I could check the status of my 
Page/Script from a nagios API Plugin and have all the lovely SiteConfidence™ error codes 
available to me instead of having to run 2 separate monitoring systems"

This plugs into your existing Nagios system and allows you to monitor your page status via 
SiteConfidence's™ super powerful API. 

Simply copy the Plugin to your PlugIns directory add it as a service to Nagios and Robert's 
your mother's brother, all that SiteConfidence™ goodness on your own Nagios.
